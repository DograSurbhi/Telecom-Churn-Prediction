# Telecom-Churn-Prediction
Churn is a one of the biggest problem in the telecom industry. This Project is all about predicting the behavior of customers with churn or no churn ,so, we can retain them and develop focused customer retention programs. The analysis has been done by exploring the overall structure of the dataset and summary statistics of each variable. Also, analyzed the number of observations, their data type. Applied feature engineering on the dataset. As the target value is categorical(discrete) so, this is a classification model and  I have used Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Classification tree in Apache Spark to solve the problem and evaluated them using AUC. At last, variable importance has been found on the basis of the best model.

Need to have jupyter to run the source fie with extension .ipynb
